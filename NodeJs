node js provide a runtime enviornment for executing javascript code on server side
neither a language nor framework
V8 is javaScript engine for the javaScript language
browser exceute javaScript code on client side while node js on the server side
express.js is a framework built on the top of node js.designed to simplify the process of the building application.
***************************
feature of node js
bidirectional communication
single threaded
asynchronous
provide node package manager(npm)
event-driven
***********
after initiating task1 thead1 will not wait for task1 to complete but it will imediately start  the task2,that is why node js is single threded and asynchronous
whenever task1 1 completed an event is emitted->thread t1 being event driven properly respond to this event,intrupting its current task  and delevring the result of task1

********************
event-signal that something has happened in the program
event-emitter->emit event
events-queue->events emiited queued in event queue
events-handler->functin that respond to specific events
events-loop->pick the events from event queue
*****************


Node js is essential for building  scalable and restful  api that handle large no of concurrent connection.| for making chat application
******************
node modules contin all the dependencies of node proect
npm is used to manage the dependency for your node project
package.json-contain metadata about the project
****************
a module contain specific functionality that can be easily resued within node js application.
module can contain multiple function and variable.

****************
// Exporting a single function
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

module.exports = add;

// Exporting an object with multiple functions/properties
module.exports = {
    add: function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    },
    subtract: function(a, b) {
        return a - b;
    }
};
// Named exports
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

module.exports = {
    add,
    subtract
};
const { add, subtract } = require('./math');
const add = require('./math').add;
***********************
type of module in node js
builtin module->(allready present module in node js which provide essential functionality)
for example filesystem,httpServer

local module-created for developer for specific functionality
third party module-
************************

builtin module->fs,path,os,events,http
fs->read the content of the file asynchronously
const fs=require('fs')
fs.readFile()
****************
path module provide utility for joining resolving and manupulating path
path.join()
path.parse()
***************
os module provide a set of method for interacting with the operating system
**************
createServer is  a methd of  http module in node js  used to create http server
**************************
// Importing the http module
const http = require('http');

// Creating an HTTP server instance
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Callback function to handle incoming requests

  // Set the response HTTP header with HTTP status and content type
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});

  // Write the response body
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});
