Object serialization is the process of converting Java objects into byte streams. We can then transfer these byte streams over the wire or store them in persistent memory. Deserialization is the reverse process, where we take byte streams and convert them back into Java objects. To allow object serialization (or deserialization), a class must implement the Serializable interface.
