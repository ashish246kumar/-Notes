React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library 
applications with a single page. 
used for building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components
make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM 
follows unidirectional data binding 
React uses virtual DOM to render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser.
**************************
Hook-->useState,useEffect,useContext,useReducer,useMemo,useRef,useCallBack

const [count, setCounter] = useState(0);
useState() is a hook provided by the React library that allows functional components to manage state
keys are special attributes that provide a way to identify unique virtual DOM elements 
<li key={item.id}>{item.text}</li>
Keys help react identify which elements were added, changed or removed.
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript  and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ).
const container = (
<div>
  <p>This is a text</p>
</div>
);
ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement)
**************************************************
Functional components promote a more functional programming style
 Class components encapsulate state and behavior within a single class instance.|more boilerplate code|no hooks
Functional components  more lightweight and have better performance| use hooks| less biolerplatecode|moderreact performance
class component has higher overhead due to the instantiation of class instances
Functional components are JavaScript functions that accept props as arguments and return React elements to describe what should appear on the screen.
class component use a render() method to return React elements.
*******************************************************************************************************************************
 the Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM maintained by React in memory. React utilizes the Virtual DOM to optimize the process of updating the UI by efficiently.
****************************
useEffect-perform side effects in function components.Side effects can include things like fetching data, subscribing to external events
useEffect(()->{
console.log("abc");
});
Runs on every render.
No dependency array means it runs after every state change or re-render.
******
useEffect with an Empty Dependency Array (Runs Once)


useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Runs only once on mount");
},[]);

useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title with the current count
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);
Runs When count Changes
You can also pass a second argument, an array of dependencie
******************************************************************
propdrelling-
parent->childA->childB->childC
when  we want to send data from parent to childC at lower hierchy we can achieve this throgh with the help of useContext with sending to each and every 
child.
//create provider useContext
const data=createContext()
const app = () => {
  const name="abc"

  return (

    <data.Provider value={name}>
     <ChildA/>
    </data.Provider>
  );
};

export default app;
export{data}
*****child C componet
import  data
function childC(){
const name=useContext(data1);
	return(
<>
<h1>{name}</h1>
</>
)


}
*****************************************
useReducer-for managing the state .preferable for complex state management logic 
const[state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,initialState)
Reducer is a function that accept two parameter
newState=reducer(currentState,action)

*****************************************
useReducer-for managing the state .preferable for complex state management logic 
const[state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,initialState)
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

Reducer is a function that accept two parameter
newState=reducer(currentState,action)
When a button is clicked, it dispatches an action object to the reducer, which updates the state accordingly.
dispatcher call the reducer function
<button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
********************************
useRef is used for manupulating the dom directly
usememo is enhance the application performance.
useMemo is a React hook used for memoizing expensive computations in functional components.
Memoizes the result of a function so that it's only recomputed when its dependencies change, preventing unnecessary calculations.
**************************************************************************
HOCs are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new component with enhanced functionality.
Use HOCs when you have logic that needs to be shared across multiple components. Instead of duplicating code in multiple places, you can create an HOC to encapsulate the shared logic.
*********************************************
lifecycle is managed by a set of lifecycle methods (life cycle method of component)
Main Lifecycle Phases:

Mounting:constructor() (optional): Set up initial state and bind methods.

Update state based on changes in props.

Updating Phase:

These methods are called when a component is being re-rendered due to changes in props or state.

Unmounting Phase:

These methods are called when a component is being removed from the DOM.

Error Handling:

These methods are called when an error occurs during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
*************************************************
props-way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.they are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  return <ChildComponent name="John" age={30} />;
};

export default ParentComponent;
const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
    </div>
  );

****************************
React Hooks are functions that enable developers to use state and other React features in functional components
*******************
A Custom Hook is a function in Javascript whose name begins with ‘use’ and which calls other hooks.

import { useState } from 'react';

function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  const reset = () => {
    setCount(initialValue);
  };

  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
}

export default useCounter;

function Counter() {
  const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = useCounter(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
*******************
StrictMode is a tool  that highlight potential problems in an application. It performs additional checks on the application.
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>,
StrictMode currently helps with the following issues:

Identifying components with unsafe lifecycle methods: 
**********************************
Re-rendering of a component when props or the state of the component has been changed.
****************

<h3 style={{ color: "Yellow" }}>This is a heading</h3>
**********************
   let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
   
    let increment = () => setCounter(++counter);
   
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment Counter</button>
        <ChildComponent counterValue={counter} />
      </div>
function ChildComponent(props) {
return (
  <div>
    <p>Value of counter: {props.counterValue}</p>
  </div>
);
}
to pass a data between two component
**********************
What are the different phases of the component lifecycle?

Initialization:During this phase by setting up the default props and initial state for the upcoming tough journey.
Mounting: Mounting refers to putting the elements into the browser DOM. The key lifecycle methods in this phase are:
constructor() → Initializes state and binds methods.
render() → Returns JSX (UI of the component).
componentDidMount() → Runs after the component is added to the DOM. Used for API calls, subscriptions, etc.


Updating: In this phase, a component will be updated when there is a change in the state or props of a component.
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) → Same as in mounting, updates state before re-render.
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) → Determines whether the component should re-render or not (optimization).
render() → Updates the UI based on new state or props

Unmounting: In this last phase of the component lifecycle, the component will be removed from the DOM.
componentWillUnmount() → Used for cleanup, like removing event listeners, aborting API calls, etc.

ErrorHandling
static getDerivedStateFromError(error) → Updates the state when an error occurs.

             How to create a component in react ?
*************************************************************
 you can create a component in two ways:
Functional Component (Recommended)
Class Component
*****
Function Component
**********
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

import React from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, this is MyComponent!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;


import React from "react";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
***************************************************************************************************************
what are pure Cmponent?
***********************************************
A Pure Component in React is a special type of component that only re-renders when its state or props change.
 It helps optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders

Using React.memo() for Functional Components
🔹 React.memo() wraps the functional component and prevents re-rendering unless props change.
*********
import React from "react";

const MyFunctionalComponent = React.memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log("Rendered!");
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
});

export default MyFunctionalComponent;
*********
import React, { useState } from "react";
import MyFunctionalComponent from "./MyFunctionalComponent";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <MyFunctionalComponent name="Ashish" />
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
*************************************
When to Use Pure Components?
✅ When dealing with components that receive the same props most of the time
✅ When optimizing performance in large applications
✅ When working with stateless functional components (use React.memo)
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is state in React?
State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. 
It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components

In functional components, state is managed using the useState hook.

import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial state = 0

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
🔹 Here, count is the state variable, and setCount updates its value.
**********************************
What are props in React?

Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes.
Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.

The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:
Pass custom data to your component.
Trigger state changes.

const ChildComponent = ({ name, age, gender = "male" }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <p>{age}</p>
      <p>{gender}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

***********
const ParentComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent name="John" age="30" gender="male" />
      <ChildComponent name="Mary" age="25" geneder="female" />
    </div>
  );
};
*************************************************************
What is the difference between state and props?
both state and props are plain JavaScript objects and used to manage the data of a component
The state entity is managed by the component itself and can be updated using the setter(setState() for class components) function

props (short for "properties") are passed to a component by its parent component and are read-only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the own component itself. 
i.e, props acts as arguments for a function.

*******************************************************
What are inline conditional expressions?

***********************
<h1>Hello!</h1>;
{
  messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (
    <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
  ) : (
    <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>
  );
}

***********************************************************************
What is Virtual DOM?

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM.
It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation.

********************************************************
How Virtual DOM works?
The Virtual DOM works in three simple steps.

Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.
Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.
Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed.
************************************************************************************************************************
What is Lifting State Up in React?


Lifting state up is a React pattern where you move the state from a child component to a common parent component so that multiple 
child components can share and synchronize the same state.
Why Do We Lift State Up?
✅ Keeps data centralized – Ensures all components that need the state can access it.
✅ Avoids prop drilling – Prevents passing state through multiple nested components.
✅ When multiple child components need access to the same data.
✅ When you need to keep related components in sync.


import React, { useState } from "react";

// Child component for input
const NameInput = ({ name, setName }) => {
  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      placeholder="Enter name"
      value={name}
      onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
};

// Child component for display
const Display = ({ name }) => <h2>Name: {name}</h2>;

// Parent component managing state
const App = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState(""); // State lifted up

  return (
    <div>
      <NameInput name={name} setName={setName} />
      <Display name={name} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

*******************************************************************************************************
What Are Higher-Order Components (HOCs) in React?(what,when,how,whom)

A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new enhanced component with additional props or behaviors.

const withLogger = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    console.log("Component rendered with props:", props);
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
};
 Why Use Higher-Order Components?
HOCs help with:
✅ Code Reusability – Extract common logic to be reused across components.
✅ Separation of Concerns – Keeps components focused on their main functionality.
✅ Enhancing Components – Add behavior like authentication, logging, styling, etc
**********************************
What is the children Prop in React?

the children prop is a special prop that allows components to wrap and render other components or elements inside them.
It enables component composition, making components more reusable and flexible.

const Wrapper = (props) => {
  return <div className="box">{props.children}</div>;
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
      <p>This is inside the Wrapper component.</p>
    </Wrapper>
  );
}

*****
const Card = ({ children }) => {
  return <div className="card">{children}</div>;
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <h3>Product Name</h3>
      <p>Price: $100</p>
    </Card>
  );
}
*****************************
Why React uses className over class attribute?

The attribute names written in JSX turned into keys of JavaScript objects and the JavaScript names cannot contain dashes or reserved words,
it is recommended to use camelCase wherever applicable in JSX code. The attribute class is a keyword in JavaScript, and JSX is an extension of JavaScript. 
That's the principle reason why React uses className instead of class. Pass a string as the className prop.
***********************************************************************************************************************
1️⃣ Single-Line Comments in JSX
{/* This is a JSX comment */}
2️⃣ Multi-Line Comments in JSX
 {/*
        This is a multi-line comment
        in JSX
      */}
👉 Use // for single-line comments and /* ... */ for multi-line comments.

  /*
    This is a multi-line
    JavaScript comment
  */
*****************************************************************************************************
What are fragments?
A Fragment in React is a lightweight wrapper that allows you to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
By default, React components must return a single parent element. If you try to return multiple elements without wrapping them, you’ll get an error

5️⃣ When to Use Fragments?
✔ When returning multiple elements inside a component.
✔ When avoiding extra <div> wrappers that clutter the DOM.
✔ When rendering lists with .map() and needing a key prop.
**********************************************************************************************************************************
What are stateless components?


A stateless component (also called a functional component) is a component that:
✔ Does not have its own state (useState)
✔ Does not use lifecycle methods (useEffect, componentDidMount, etc.)
✔ Only depends on props to render UI

Example of a Stateless Component
✅ Functional (Stateless) Component
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Greeting name="Ashish" />

3️⃣ When to Use Stateless Components?
✔ When the component only renders UI
✔ When using props to display dynamic content
✔ When you want better performance & reusability
******************************************************************************************************************
what is Stateful Component


A stateful component is a React component that manages its own state using either:
✔ Class component with this.state
✔ Functional component with useState or other state management hooks
***************************************************************************************************************
How to Apply Validation on Props in React? 🚀
In React, you can validate props using PropTypes, which helps catch errors and improve code maintainability.
npm install prop-types

Use PropTypes in your component to specify the expected data types for props.

import React from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types"; // Import PropTypes

function UserProfile({ name, age, isAdmin }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Name: {name}</h2>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      <p>Admin: {isAdmin ? "Yes" : "No"}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// ✅ Applying prop validation
UserProfile.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,  // Required string
  age: PropTypes.number,              // Optional number
  isAdmin: PropTypes.bool             // Boolean
};

// Default props (optional)
UserProfile.defaultProps = {
  age: 18,
  isAdmin: false
};

export default UserProfile;
****************************************************************
How to use styles in React?


You can apply styles directly using the style attribute, which takes an object with camelCase property names
<div style={{ backgroundColor: "lightblue", padding: "20px", borderRadius: "10px" }}>
      <h2 style={{ color: "darkblue", textAlign: "center" }}>Hello, React!</h2>
    </div>
****
const divStyle = {
  color: "blue",
  backgroundImage: "url(" + imgUrl + ")",
};

function HelloWorldComponent() {
  return <div style={divStyle}>Hello World!</div>;
}
*************************************************************************
How Events Are Different in React? 🔥🚀

Unlike vanilla JavaScript where events use lowercase (onclick, onmouseover), React uses camelCase (onClick, onMouseOver).
**********************
How do you conditionally render components?


function Greeting(props) {
  return (
    <h1>{props.isLoggedIn ? "Welcome Back!" : "Please Log In"}</h1>
  );
}

export default Greeting;
****
<div>
      {props.isLoggedIn && <h1>Welcome Back!</h1>}
    </div>
******
function Greeting(props) {
  const renderMessage = () => {
    if (props.isLoggedIn) {
      return <h1>Welcome Back!</h1>;
    } else {
      return <h1>Please Log In</h1>;
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {renderMessage()}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Greeting;
