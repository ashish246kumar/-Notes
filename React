React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library 
applications with a single page. 
used for building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components
make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM 
follows unidirectional data binding 
React uses virtual DOM to render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser.
**************************
const [count, setCounter] = useState(0);
useState() is a hook provided by the React library that allows functional components to manage state
keys are special attributes that provide a way to identify unique virtual DOM elements 
<li key={item.id}>{item.text}</li>
Keys help react identify which elements were added, changed or removed.
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript  and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ).
const container = (
<div>
  <p>This is a text</p>
</div>
);
ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement)
**************************************************
Functional components promote a more functional programming style
 Class components encapsulate state and behavior within a single class instance.|more boilerplate code|no hooks
Functional components  more lightweight and have better performance| use hooks| less biolerplatecode|moderreact performance
class component has higher overhead due to the instantiation of class instances
Functional components are JavaScript functions that accept props as arguments and return React elements to describe what should appear on the screen.
class component use a render() method to return React elements.
*******************************************************************************************************************************
 the Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM maintained by React in memory. React utilizes the Virtual DOM to optimize the process of updating the UI by efficiently.
****************************
useEffect-perform side effects in function components.Side effects can include things like fetching data, subscribing to external events
useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title with the current count
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);
The function will be executed after every render by default.
You can also pass a second argument, an array of dependencie
******************************************************************
propdrelling-
parent->childA->childB->childC
when  we want to send data from parent to childC at lower hierchy we can achieve this throgh with the help of useContext with sending to each and every 
child.
//create provider useContext
const data=createContext()
const app = () => {
  const name="abc"

  return (

    <data.Provider value={name}>
     <ChildA/>
    </data.Provider>
  );
};

export default app;
export{data}
*****child C componet
import  data
function childC(){
const name=useContext(data1);
	return(
<>
<h1>{name}</h1>
</>
)


}
*****************************************
useReducer-for managing the state .preferable for complex state management logic 
const[state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,initialState)
Reducer is a function that accept two parameter
newState=reducer(currentState,action)

*****************************************
useReducer-for managing the state .preferable for complex state management logic 
const[state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,initialState)
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

Reducer is a function that accept two parameter
newState=reducer(currentState,action)
When a button is clicked, it dispatches an action object to the reducer, which updates the state accordingly.
dispatcher call the reducer function
<button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
********************************
useRef is used for manupulating the dom directly
usememo is enhance the application performance.
useMemo is a React hook used for memoizing expensive computations in functional components.
Memoizes the result of a function so that it's only recomputed when its dependencies change, preventing unnecessary calculations.
**************************************************************************
HOCs are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new component with enhanced functionality.
Use HOCs when you have logic that needs to be shared across multiple components. Instead of duplicating code in multiple places, you can create an HOC to encapsulate the shared logic.
*********************************************
lifecycle is managed by a set of lifecycle methods 
Main Lifecycle Phases:

Mounting:constructor() (optional): Set up initial state and bind methods.

Update state based on changes in props.

Updating Phase:

These methods are called when a component is being re-rendered due to changes in props or state.

Unmounting Phase:

These methods are called when a component is being removed from the DOM.

Error Handling:

These methods are called when an error occurs during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
*************************************************
props-way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.they are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  return <ChildComponent name="John" age={30} />;
};

export default ParentComponent;
const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
    </div>
  );

****************************
React Hooks are functions that enable developers to use state and other React features in functional components
*******************
A Custom Hook is a function in Javascript whose name begins with ‘use’ and which calls other hooks.

import { useState } from 'react';

function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  const reset = () => {
    setCount(initialValue);
  };

  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
}

export default useCounter;

function Counter() {
  const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = useCounter(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
*******************
StrictMode is a tool  that highlight potential problems in an application. It performs additional checks on the application.
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>,
StrictMode currently helps with the following issues:

Identifying components with unsafe lifecycle methods: 
**********************************
Re-rendering of a component when props or the state of the component has been changed.
****************

<h3 style={{ color: "Yellow" }}>This is a heading</h3>
**********************
   let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
   
    let increment = () => setCounter(++counter);
   
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment Counter</button>
        <ChildComponent counterValue={counter} />
      </div>
function ChildComponent(props) {
return (
  <div>
    <p>Value of counter: {props.counterValue}</p>
  </div>
);
}
to pass a data between two component
**********************
What are the different phases of the component lifecycle?

Initialization:During this phase by setting up the default props and initial state for the upcoming tough journey.
Mounting: Mounting refers to putting the elements into the browser DOM. The key lifecycle methods in this phase are:
constructor() → Initializes state and binds methods.
render() → Returns JSX (UI of the component).
componentDidMount() → Runs after the component is added to the DOM. Used for API calls, subscriptions, etc.


Updating: In this phase, a component will be updated when there is a change in the state or props of a component.
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) → Same as in mounting, updates state before re-render.
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) → Determines whether the component should re-render or not (optimization).
render() → Updates the UI based on new state or props

Unmounting: In this last phase of the component lifecycle, the component will be removed from the DOM.
componentWillUnmount() → Used for cleanup, like removing event listeners, aborting API calls, etc.

ErrorHandling
static getDerivedStateFromError(error) → Updates the state when an error occurs.

             How to create a component in react ?
*************************************************************
 you can create a component in two ways:
Functional Component (Recommended)
Class Component
*****
Function Component
**********
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

import React from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, this is MyComponent!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;


import React from "react";
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
***************************************************************************************************************
what are pure Cmponent?
***********************************************
A Pure Component in React is a special type of component that only re-renders when its state or props change.
 It helps optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders

Using React.memo() for Functional Components
🔹 React.memo() wraps the functional component and prevents re-rendering unless props change.
*********
import React from "react";

const MyFunctionalComponent = React.memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log("Rendered!");
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
});

export default MyFunctionalComponent;
*********
import React, { useState } from "react";
import MyFunctionalComponent from "./MyFunctionalComponent";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <MyFunctionalComponent name="Ashish" />
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
*************************************
When to Use Pure Components?
✅ When dealing with components that receive the same props most of the time
✅ When optimizing performance in large applications
✅ When working with stateless functional components (use React.memo)
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is state in React?
State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. 
It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components

In functional components, state is managed using the useState hook.

import React, { useState } from "react";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial state = 0

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
🔹 Here, count is the state variable, and setCount updates its value.
**********************************
What are props in React?

Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes.
Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.

The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:
Pass custom data to your component.
Trigger state changes.

const ChildComponent = ({ name, age, gender = "male" }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <p>{age}</p>
      <p>{gender}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

***********
const ParentComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent name="John" age="30" gender="male" />
      <ChildComponent name="Mary" age="25" geneder="female" />
    </div>
  );
};
*************************************************************
What is the difference between state and props?
both state and props are plain JavaScript objects and used to manage the data of a component
The state entity is managed by the component itself and can be updated using the setter(setState() for class components) function

props (short for "properties") are passed to a component by its parent component and are read-only, meaning that they cannot be modified by the own component itself. 
i.e, props acts as arguments for a function.

*******************************************************
What are inline conditional expressions?

***********************
<h1>Hello!</h1>;
{
  messages.length > 0 && !isLogin ? (
    <h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.</h2>
  ) : (
    <h2>You don't have unread messages.</h2>
  );
}

***********************************************************************
What is Virtual DOM?

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM.
It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation.
