@COMPONENT->it tell the spring container to automatically create spring bean.It indicate that annotated class is spring bean or component.
3types of configuration-Java Based,xml based and annotation based
when we use @Component we donot need to create object by new keyword
@Autowired-used to inject bean automatically
@Autowired-used in constrctor injection, setter injection and field injection.
@Qualifiier-used in conjuction with autowired  to avoid confusion when we have two or more bean configured for same type
 private  ExampleInterface exampleInterface;
@Autowired
public ExampleService(@Qualifier("implementationA") ExampleInterface exampleInterface) {
        this.exampleInterface = exampleInterface;
    }
ExampleInterface  is implemented by implementationA class and implementationB class.if we not use @Qualifier annotation here then there will 
confusion that which class bean it will  create implemetationA or implementationB
@Primary-to give higher preference to bean when there are multiple bean of same type.
@Component
@Primary
public class ImplementationB implements ExampleInterface {
    @Override
    public void doSomething() {
        // Implementation B
    }
}
 private  ExampleInterface exampleInterface;
@Autowired
public ExampleService( ExampleInterface exampleInterface) {
        this.exampleInterface = exampleInterface;
    }
*****************************
@Bean-method produces a bean to be managed  by the spring container
public class vegPizza implements Pizza{

  public String getPizza(){
   return "vegPizza";
}
}
@Configuration
public class AppConfig{

 @Bean
public Pizza vegPizza(){
    return new VegPizza()
}
@Bean 
public PizzController pizzController(){
     return new PizzaController(vegPizza());
}
}

public class PizzaController{

private Pizza pizza;
public PizzaController(Pizza pizza){
   this.pizza=pizza
}
public String getPizza(){
   return pizza.getPizza();
}
}
@Bean provide init method and destroy method to perform certain action after bean initilzation or before bean destruction by the container.
@Bean annotation to create Spring Bean definitions using Java-based configuration.
*********************
@Controller-for handling http request @ResponseBody  is not included
@RestController is used for creating RESTful APIs 
**********************************************
@Lazy-@Lazy annotation to load the Spring beans lazily (on-demand).
By default Spring crete all the bean eagrly at the startup or bootStraping of the application context.
@Lazy can be useful for beans that are resource-intensive
**********************
@Scope annotation is used to define the scope of the bean
Singleton: only one instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire application. This is the default scope.

Prototype: a new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested.
@Component
@Scope("singleton")
public class MySingletonBean {
    // Singleton bean properties and methods...
}
**********************
@SpringBootApplication-->it is mark over the main class over the spring boot application.It is a combination of @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan.
@RestController-->It indicate that the class is a web controller.and that its methods return data directly in the HTTP response body.
combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody.
@RequestMapping-->Used to map web requests to specific handler classes or handler methods. It can be applied at the class level or method level.
@Service->Indicates that a class is a service component.
@Repository-->Indicates that a class is a repository component
  @Value("${my.property}")-->it is used to get the property from application.property
@Conditional-->Marks a configuration class or bean as conditional, meaning it will only be processed if a specified condition is met.
@EnableAutoConfiguration---->Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism, which attempts to automatically configure your Spring application 
based on the jar dependencies you have added
@Async-->Indicates that a method should be executed asynchronously.
@EnableAsync-->Enables Spring’s asynchronous method execution capability.
@Scheduled-->Used to mark a method to be scheduled and executed at fixed intervals.
@EnableScheduling-->Enables Spring’s scheduled task execution capability.

************************************
In Spring, both @Configuration and @Component are annotations used to define beans,.
difference between @Configuration and @Component
@Configuration-->Methods annotated with @Bean inside a @Configuration class are used to define and configure beans.@Configuration class can have one or more bean defined
@Component-> The class itself is treated as a bean definition.It is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
******************************************************************************
difference between @RestController and @Controller
@Controller--> Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller.Return Type: Methods usually return ModelAndView or String representing the view name. 
To return JSON or XML, methods need to be annotated with @ResponseBody. Suitable for applications serving web pages and using views
@RestController-->@Controller that is used for RESTful web services.Methods return the response body directly (usually JSON or XML) instead of a view.
**************************************
@GetMapping(value = "/user", produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_VALUE)
**********************************************************************************
@ComponentScan-->used to specify the base packages to scan for Spring components (i.e., classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, etc.).
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.myapp")
