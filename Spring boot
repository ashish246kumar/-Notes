@COMPONENT->it tell the spring container to automatically create spring bean.It indicate that annotated class is spring bean or component.
3types of configuration-Java Based,xml based and annotation based
when we use @Component we donot need to create object by new keyword
@Autowired-used to inject bean automatically
@Autowired-used in constrctor injection, setter injection and field injection.
@Qualifiier-used in conjuction with autowired  to avoid confusion when we have two or more bean configured for same type
 private  ExampleInterface exampleInterface;
@Autowired
public ExampleService(@Qualifier("implementationA") ExampleInterface exampleInterface) {
        this.exampleInterface = exampleInterface;
    }
ExampleInterface  is implemented by implementationA class and implementationB class.if we not use @Qualifier annotation here then there will 
confusion that which class bean it will  create implemetationA or implementationB
