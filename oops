Polymorphism
The word ‘polymorphism’ means ‘having many forms’. considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. 
In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
 In simple words, we can define Java Polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one 
Real-life Illustration of Polymorphism in Java: A person can have different characteristics at the same time. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee.
Types of Java Polymorphism
In Java Polymorphism is mainly divided into two types: 
Compile-time Polymorphism
Runtime Polymorphism
Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java
It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading
Method Overloading
When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded.by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.
class Helper {

    // Method with 2 integer parameters
    static int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        // Returns product of integer numbers
        return a * b;
    }

    // Method 2
    // With same name but with 2 double parameters
    static double Multiply(double a, double b)
    {
        // Returns product of double numbers
        return a * b;
    }
}
Runtime Polymorphism in Java
It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch
This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. Method overriding,
