job-->aapko apna code clone karna hai . this is kind of job
aap ek computer se dusre computer me connect kar sakte ho through ssh. through public or private key
a ko agar b se connect karna hai toh a ke pas private key hoga aur b ke pas public key

Jenkins is the most popular open source CI/CD tool

Jenkins is used to build and test your product continuously, so developers can continuously integrate changes into the build.

Docker is essentially a toolkit that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update, and stop containers using simple commands and work-saving automation through a single API

Docker container is a box or process that contains all the resources require for any Operating System.
we can use Docker Container to deploy our APP . 

A Docker image contains application code, libraries, tools, dependencies and other files needed to make an application run

Dockerfile is a file where we define all the requirements which we want in the docker image. 
It has keywords like FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD etc. We can use this Dockerfile to build the image by using docker build command

Docker Compose is a tool that helps us easily handle multiple containers at once. Docker Compose works by applying many rules declared within a single docker-compose.yml configuration file.

*********************************************************************************************************************************
docker start Jenkins
This command starts the Docker container named jenkins.
The output jenkins confirms that the container has been started.

2. Checking Running Containers
   docker ps
  This lists all running Docker containers.
  The output shows that the jenkins container is running and is mapped to port 8080 on the host.

4. Stopping the Jenkins Container

docker stop jenkins
This stops the running jenkins container.

5. Reattempting to Run a New Jenkins Container

6. Starting the Jenkins Container Again
docker start Jenkins
This restarts the existing jenkins container.

7. Checking Docker Images
docker images
This lists all Docker images available on your system.
The output shows various images, including jenkins/jenkins:latest and others related to springbootwithdocker.

9. Adding Jenkins User to Docker Group
sudo usermod -aG docker Jenkins
This command attempts to add the jenkins user to the docker group.
The error usermod: user 'jenkins' does not exist occurs because the jenkins user does not exist on the host system. The jenkins user exists only inside the Docker container

10. Checking Jenkins User on Host
cat /etc/passwd | grep Jenkins
This checks if the jenkins user exists on the host system.
The output is empty, confirming that the jenkins user does not exist on the host.

11. Checking Jenkins Service Status
systemctl status jenkins
This checks if the Jenkins service is running on the host.
The error Unit jenkins.service could not be found occurs because Jenkins is running inside a Docker container, not as a system service on the host.

12. Accessing the Jenkins Container Shell
docker exec -it jenkins /bin/bash
This opens an interactive shell inside the jenkins container.
The groups jenkins command inside the container shows that the jenkins user belongs to the jenkins group.

13. Attempting to Modify Jenkins User Inside the Container
usermod -aG docker jenkins
This command tries to add the jenkins user to the docker group inside the container.
The error usermod: Permission denied occurs because the jenkins user does not have sufficient permissions to modify system files inside the container

docker exec -u root -it jenkins /bin/bash
This opens an interactive shell inside the jenkins container as the root user.
The usermod -aG docker jenkins command successfully adds the jenkins user to the docker group.

docker restart jenkins
This restarts the jenkins container to apply the changes made to the jenkins user.

sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
This changes the permissions of the Docker socket to allow non-root users to access it.
After this, the jenkins user inside the container can interact with the Docker daemon.


docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:latest
docker run → Runs a new container from an image.
-d → Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
-p 8080:8080 → Maps port 8080 on your host machine to port 8080 inside the container.
Jenkins UI runs on port 8080.
-p 50000:50000 → Maps port 50000 on your host machine to port 50000 inside the container.
Jenkins uses port 50000 for communication with agents.
--name jenkins → Assigns the container the name jenkins, so you can refer to it easily.
jenkins/jenkins:latest → Pulls the latest Jenkins image from Docker Hub and runs it.


The first 8080 (before :) is the port on the host machine (your computer).
The second 8080 (after :) is the port inside the Docker container where Jenkins is running.

Automated Testing Pipeline Mein Kaise Fit Hota Hai?
Ek typical CI/CD pipeline ka flow dekho:

Code Push: Developer code ko Git repo mein push karta hai.
Build: CI server (jaise Jenkins, GitHub Actions) code ko build karta hai (compile, dependencies resolve).
Automated Tests: Yahan tests chalte hain:
Unit Tests: Chhote functions check karte hain.
Integration Tests: Alag-alag modules ke connection check karte hain.
End-to-End Tests: Pura application flow check karte hain.
Performance/Security Tests: System ki speed aur safety check karte hain.
Deploy: Agar tests pass hote hain, toh code staging ya production mein jata hai.

************
Build Artifact Ka Role CI/CD Mein
CI/CD pipeline mein build artifact ek bridge ki tarah kaam karta hai jo build phase se test aur deploy phase tak jata hai. Yeh pipeline ke different stages ke beech kaam aata hai, taaki har stage same output pe kaam kare.

Pipeline Flow mein Artifacts:

Code Push: Developer code ko repo mein push karta hai.
Build: Pipeline code ko compile karta hai aur artifacts banata hai (jaise .jar, Docker image).
Test: Yeh artifacts testing ke liye use hote hain (unit tests, integration tests).
Deploy: Agar tests pass hote hain, toh artifacts staging ya production mein deploy hote hain.


1. Artifacts Ko Store Karo
Kahan Store Karte Hain?
Artifacts ko ek dedicated artifact repository ya storage mein rakha jata hai.
Common tools: Nexus, JFrog Artifactory, AWS S3, Azure Artifacts, GitHub Packages.
CI/CD tools (jaise Jenkins, GitLab) apne built-in storage bhi dete hain chhote projects ke liye.
Kyun Store Karte Hain?
Artifacts ko baad mein testing, deployment, ya rollback ke liye use karna hota hai.
Har build ka artifact versioned hota hai, taaki pata rahe kaun sa build kab bana.

jenkin default port 8080
 
 jenkin can be installed through war file or linux or docker
 
 war file installation
  sudo apt-get uodate -y
  sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk -y
  
  download latest war 
  sudo wget https://
  
  run the war
