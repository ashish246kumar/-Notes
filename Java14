With the help of record we can create special type of class which help to create data carrying obect.
Record consist of one or more data field, java compiler will auto generate getter method equals, hasMethod and toString
Record are final means no other class can extend that record
we can use multiple constructor
we can create instance method
we can create static method also inside record
Record objects are immutable once created value can not be changed.
*******************
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    // No need to explicitly declare constructors, getters, toString, hashCode, or equals.
}
*************
Person p1 = new Person("John", "33");
String name = p1.name()
int age = p1.age();

//Comparing the two instances
Person p2 = new Person("John", "33");
if(p1.equals(p2)) {
  System.out.println("Objects are equal");
}
