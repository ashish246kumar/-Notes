 each microservice is focused on single business capability. Search, Rating & Review and Payment each have their instance (server) and communicate with each other.
Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services.
Advantages:
Scalability: Microservices architecture allows for individual services to be scaled independently based on demand. 
Microservices architecture allows teams to choose the most suitable technologies, programming languages, and frameworks for each service.
Fault isolation, e., a process failure should not bring the whole system down.
Disadvantages:
If you are using Microservice architecture, you need to ready for operations overhead.
Increased Complexity
Microservices always rely on each other. Therefore, they need to communicate with each other.
Name  commonly used tools for Microservices.
Docker: Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.
Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library.Hystrix implements the Circuit Breaker pattern, which monitors the health of external dependencies. 
If the failure rate exceeds a certain threshold, Hystrix opens the circuit, preventing further requests from being sent to that service.
In Monolithic Architecture all the software components of an application are clubbed inside a single package.
Microservices are loosely coupled architecture.
Monolithic architecture is mostly tightly coupled.
What is RESTful?
Representational State Transfer (REST)/RESTful web services is an architectural style that helps computer systems to communicate over the internet.
***************************************
How independent micro-services communicate with each other?
It depends upon your project needs. However, in most cases, developers use HTTP/REST with JSON or Binary protocol. However, they can use any communication protocol.
What is the meaning of OAuth?
OAuth means open authorization protocol.  It helps you to share resources stored on one site with another site without the need for their credentials.
Containers are easiest and effective method to manage the microservice based application. It also helps you to develop and deploy individually.
 open-standard authorization protocol
