💡 Mini Task Given

*******************************
 Design API to fetch products from server and what to do when we have large amount of data to fetch in spring boot
 ****
  

*************

 . What moves a thread from Runnable to Running? What does Thread.yield() do?
 Ans: When a thread is in the Runnable state, it means it’s ready to run but waiting for the CPU.
 The CPU scheduler (part of the Operating System) decides when it should move to Running. The JVM doesn’t control when exactly it runs.
Thread.yield() tells the thread scheduler, “I’m willing to let other threads run first.” But it’s just a suggestion ,the thread might continue running if no other thread is ready.
Example:
 Suppose you have multiple background tasks running. You can call yield() to let another thread finish first, especially in multitasking environments.

2. Why did Java 8 introduce default and static methods in interfaces?
Ans: Before Java 8, interfaces could only have method declarations — no method bodies.
 Java 8 introduced default and static methods to allow interfaces to evolve without breaking old code.
This helped:
Add new features (like forEach() in Iterable) without changing every implementation.
Provide common reusable logic in interfaces.
Use Case Example:
 If you have an interface Vehicle, you can add a default void start() method — existing classes like Car or Bike don’t need to change to get this behavior. 

3. SynchronizedMap vs ConcurrentHashMap — Which is better in multi-threaded apps?
Ans: SynchronizedMap locks the entire map during any operation. It is simple but slow in multi-threaded apps.
ConcurrentHashMap divides the map into segments and locks only the part being used. This makes it much faster in concurrent environments.
Use Case Example:
 If multiple threads update and read from a shared cache or map, use ConcurrentHashMap for better performance and safety. 

4. What is the Decomposition Pattern in Microservices?
Ans: It is a method of breaking down a large monolithic application into smaller, independent microservices.
 Each service handles a specific business function, such as Orders, Payments, or Notifications.
Common strategies:
Decomposition by Business Capability
Decomposition by Subdomain (from Domain-Driven Design
Use Case Example:
 In an e-commerce app, splitting the system into services like ProductService, CartService, PaymentService helps develop, deploy, and scale them independently.

5. How do you monitor logs in Spring Boot applications?
Ans: Spring Boot provides built-in support using Spring Boot Actuator to expose metrics and health endpoints.
 For centralized logging and monitoring:
Use tools like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
Or Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and alerting.
Use Case Example:
 In production, instead of checking logs on each server, logs are sent to Elasticsearch and visualized in Kibana. This helps in tracking errors, request flows, and app performance from one place.

***************
❓ 𝗤: Why is String immutable in Java?
🔹 In Java, when we say a String is immutable, it means once it is created, it cannot be changed.
 If you try to change it, Java will actually create a new object, not modify the original one.

🧠 But why did Java make String immutable?
✅ 1. Security:
 String is used in sensitive areas like file paths, database URLs, and network connections.
 If it could be changed, hackers might easily break things.

✅ 2. Memory Efficiency (String Pool):
 Java stores strings in a special memory area called the String pool.
 Since strings don’t change, Java can reuse them to save memory.

✅ 3. Thread Safety:
 Multiple threads can use the same string without problems, because it can’t change.
*************************

Let’s decode it with simplicity 👇

🔹 A HashMap stores key-value pairs using a hashing mechanism.
🔹 When two keys hash to the same index, it’s called a collision 🚧.
🔹 But how does it handle these collisions? 🤨

✨ Here’s the internal magic:

1️⃣ Bucket System 🪣
Each index in the HashMap array is a bucket that can hold multiple entries.

2️⃣ Chaining using Linked List 🔗
Initially, Java uses a linked list to store multiple entries in the same bucket.

3️⃣ Switch to Tree after Threshold 🌳
If too many collisions happen at the same index (more than 8), Java 8+ converts the bucket to a Red-Black Tree for faster lookup time — from O(n) to O(log n)

Java Internals: Hashmap

🧠 You Need to Store 500 Entries in a HashMap - What Would You Do?

Let’s say you’re building a system to store information about the Fortune 500 companies.

You know you’ll have exactly 500 entries.

So how do you initialize your HashMap?

// Option 1: Default constructor
Map<Integer, CompanyDetails> map = new HashMap<>();

// Option 2: Set initial capacity
Map<Integer, CompanyDetails> map = new HashMap<>(500);

Seems logical, right?

But

🔍 What actually happens under the hood?

Option 1 - Default constructor:
 • Starts with 16 buckets
 • Inserts 500 entries → triggers multiple internal resizes
 • Each resize = rehashing + memory copy = performance hit

Option 2 - Specifying 500:
 • Internally rounded to 512 buckets
 • But there’s a hidden threshold: only 75% can be filled before resize
 • So adding 500 entries? Still triggers another resize to 1024


✅ What’s the smarter choice?

You need to account for that hidden threshold a.k.a the load factor (default = 0.75).

To avoid resizing, use:

int expectedSize = 500;
int capacity = (int)(expectedSize / 0.75f) + 1; // ~668
Map<Integer, CompanyDetails> map = new HashMap<>(capacity);


 • Prevents resizing
 • Saves CPU cycles
 • Predictable memory usage

****************************
hy You Should Always Use @Transactional Carefully in Spring

When working with databases in Spring, it's tempting to put @Transactional on every method. But here's what I’ve learned after working on real-world Java backend systems:

1- Don’t use @Transactional on private methods
 Spring uses proxies for transaction management. Private methods won’t be intercepted — your transaction won’t work!

2- Be mindful of self-invocation
 Calling a @Transactional method from another method in the same class? It won’t work — because the proxy isn’t used internally.

3- Use proper propagation and isolation levels
 Not all transactions are created equal. Understand REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW, and SUPPORTS — it can make or break consistency.

4- Exception handling matters
 By default, Spring rolls back only on unchecked exceptions. Want rollback on checked exceptions too? Use:
 @Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class)

5- Avoid overuse
 Transactional boundaries should be clearly defined. Too large — and you lock resources. Too small — and you risk partial failure.
***************
1️⃣ What architecture are you using in your Spring Boot application?

Controller Layer (Presentation Layer)
Service Layer (Business Logic Layer)
Repository Layer (Data Access Layer)
Model/Entity Layer
DTO Layer (Optional but recommended)
Mapper Layer (Optional)


2️⃣ What improvements can be made to the basic CRUD operations?
Validation
Input validation on request payloads using annotations (@NotNull, @Size, @Email, etc.) or custom validators.
DTO Usage
Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to separate API layer from entity layer.
Avoid exposing internal database schema directly.

Standardized Response Format
Return a consistent response structure with status, message, and data

Logging
Log all create, update, delete operations
Use audit fields like createdBy, createdAt, updatedBy, updatedAt.

Pagination and Filtering for Read Operations

Unit and Integration Tests
Ensure you write tests for all CRUD operations

Soft Deletes
Instead of deleting records, mark them as inactive (isDeleted = true).

Caching for Read Operations

Bulk Operations
Support batch inserts or updates to improve performance.

Error Handling
Use @ControllerAdvice to handle exceptions gracefully.






3️⃣ What are the core rules and best practices of REST API design?

4️⃣ When a new record is added to the database, how is it retrieved? Will the cache reflect the new data?

✅ Core Rules of REST API Design
1️⃣ Use Proper HTTP Methods
GET → Retrieve data
POST → Create new resource

2️⃣ Use Nouns, Not Verbs in URLs
✅ Good: /users, /products/1
❌ Bad: /getUsers, /createProduct


Use Consistent and Hierarchical Resource URIs
/users               → all users
/users/123           → user with ID 123
/users/123/orders    → orders of user 123

Use HTTP Status Codes Correctly
200 OK – Success
201 Created – New resource created
204 No Content – Successful with no response body
400 Bad Request – Invalid input

URLs should represent resources, not actions.

📄 2. Use Pagination, Sorting, and Filtering
For large collections:

Version Your APIs
URI versioning

🔐 1. Authentication & Authorization
Use OAuth2, JWT, or API keys.



5️⃣ If the Department is part of another microservice, how would you access its data?
✅ 1️⃣ Use REST API with Feign Client (Recommended in Spring Boot)
Step 1: Add OpenFeign dependency in pom.xml
Step 2: Enable Feign Clients
Step 3: Create Feign Client Interface
 Use it in Your Service
 
****************************





6️⃣ If the Employee entity has 20–25 fields, how do you handle partial updates during the update operation? How do you prevent overwriting existing values with null?

Deep understanding of Java 17/21 (Streams, Records, CompletableFuture)

Spring Boot internals (bean lifecycle, profiles, conditional beans)

Microservices design patterns (API Gateway, Circuit Breaker, Config Server)

Asynchronous communication with Kafka or RabbitMQ

Hibernate knowledge beyond annotations (lazy loading, N+1, migrations)

Testing strategy (unit, integration, contract testing)

DevOps basics (Docker, CI/CD, containerization)

System design thinking (scale, resilience, communication)
***************************
 Scenario 2: Long-Running Requests / Async Processing

Q: A user triggers a long-running operation (e.g., report generation). How would you ensure a non-blocking experience?
 A:
Use @Async with @EnableAsync.
Return a CompletableFuture<> or use messaging queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka.
Notify user via WebSocket, polling, or email.

Scenario 3: Connecting to Multiple Databases

Q: Your application needs to connect to two different databases. How would you configure it?
*********************
spring 3.5 

Triggering Quartz Jobs From the Actuator:
Spring Boot 3.5 has introduced a new feature that allows us to trigger Quartz jobs on demand via the Actuator HTTP API.
This enhancement enables direct, runtime control of scheduled jobs — useful for operational tasks, testing, or manual interventions.

6️⃣Customizing Structured Logging Stack Traces:
The Structured Logging feature was introduced in Spring Boot 3.4. Spring Boot 3.5 has introduced a new feature to Structured Logging, enabling us to customize how stack traces are included in outputs.
This customization for structured logging gives us granular control over log output, making it easier to optimize logs for our operational

*******************************
Java Internals: Why hashCode() and equals() Are So Famous in Interviews

🧠 Ever wonder why interviewers love this question?
Because it breaks your code silently - even when everything looks right.
Here’s a real-world analogy 👇

🏢 Imagine This - You're managing a company’s employee database.
You hire Krishna (ID: 101) and add him to your office entry system (a HashSet):

Set<Employee> entrySystem = new HashSet<>();
entrySystem.add(new Employee("Krishna", 101));

Later, Krishna shows up at the door. The system checks:

entrySystem.contains(new Employee("Krishna", 101)); // ❌ Access Denied?!

But… why?! Same name, same ID.

🔍 The Reason
Java doesn’t compare by data - it uses:
hashCode() → to find the right bucket
equals() → to check if it’s a match

If you don’t override them, Java compares memory locations - so Krishna looks like a stranger.


✅ The Fix
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
 return this.id == o.id && this.name.equals(o.name);
}

@Override
public int hashCode() {
 return Objects.hash(name, id);
}

Now Krishna gets access ✅ No duplicate entries. No silent bugs. ✅

🎯 Takeaway
HashSet and HashMap need your logic to compare objects.
That’s why this question never goes out of fashion in interviews - it shows your understanding of how Java works under the hood.

***************************
ResponseEntity<T> is a class provided by Spring that represents the entire HTTP response.
Benefits of Using ResponseEntity in Spring Boot

Using ResponseEntity gives you more power and flexibility over your HTTP response.
Control HTTP Status Code
Without ResponseEntity, your controller always returns 200 OK by default.
Without ResponseEntity, adding headers becomes difficult or impossible.
With ResponseEntity, you can test not just the body, but also:
Status code
Headers
Content type

Dockerizing a Spring Boot Application – A Game Changer in Deployment! 🐳☕

In the real world of Java development, deploying applications efficiently is just as important as building them. Recently, I worked on containerizing a Spring Boot app using Docker, and the benefits were huge:
✅ Simplified deployment
 ✅ Environment consistency
 ✅ Easy scaling
 ✅ Smooth integration with CI/CD pipelines
What I did:
 🔹 Created a lightweight Dockerfile with OpenJDK
 🔹 Used multi-stage builds to reduce image size
 🔹 Externalized configuration with application.yml and Docker volumes
 🔹 Ran the app smoothly using docker-compose
💡 Pro Tip: Always keep your Docker images slim! Use jlink or an Alpine base image where possible.
Whether you’re working in a startup or a large enterprise, Dockerizing your Spring Boot services can save time and reduce headaches during deployment.

Spring Boot + Kafka – Real-Time Messaging Made Easy ..

In a recent backend project, I integrated Apache Kafka with Spring Boot to handle real-time communication between microservices — and it was a game changer for performance and scalability.

🚀 Why Kafka?
Kafka provides high-throughput, fault-tolerant messaging — perfect for decoupling services and processing data streams in real time.

🧩 What Spring Boot Kafka Integration Offers:
✅ Easy setup using spring-kafka dependency
 ✅ Simple configuration for producers and consumers
 ✅ Built-in error handling, retry, and batch processing
 ✅ Supports JSON (and Avro) serialization
 ✅ Smooth integration with monitoring tools (like Actuator, Prometheus)

💡 Real-World Use Cases:
Logging user activity across services
Triggering notifications and emails
Order placement and inventory updates
Stream processing and analytics pipelines
By combining Kafka’s messaging power with Spring Boot’s simplicity, we built a system that was fast, scalable, and much easier to maintain — without relying on direct API calls everywhere.
If you're building microservices or event-driven systems, this combo is worth exploring.

 Using Kafka CLI to Create Topics & Test Messaging – The Dev’s Quick Playground 

Before diving deep into production-grade Kafka integrations, I like to start with the Kafka CLI tools — they’re simple, fast, and give you a clear understanding of how Kafka works under the hood.
Recently, I used the CLI to spin up a few topics and test producer/consumer flow locally — and it helped me debug and validate things quickly.

🔧 What you can do with Kafka CLI:
✅ Create topics — name them, set partitions, define replication
 ✅ Produce messages — send test events straight from the terminal
 ✅ Consume messages — listen to real-time data flow and debug message content
 ✅ Describe topics — see configs, partition count, replication details
 ✅ List topics — view what’s available in the cluster

💡 Real-World Use:
When building Kafka apps with Spring Boot, I often use the CLI to:
Test message flow before wiring up the backend
Simulate consumer failures and retry behavior
Watch what’s really being published to the topic
Troubleshoot serialization or topic config issues
Even in big projects, Kafka CLI remains one of the simplest ways to interact directly with your broker — perfect for testing, learning, and debugging.

Java Concurrency – Key Concepts I Revisited During Recent Interviews 🧵

Recently, while preparing for and attending Java interviews, I had the chance to revisit some core concurrency concepts that are both fundamental and often asked. Sharing a quick summary of what I refreshed and learned:

🔹 Thread Joining
Using thread.join() allows one thread to wait for the completion of another — helpful for sequencing tasks or ensuring dependencies are respected.

🔹 How Threads Signal Completion
Threads don’t “notify” completion explicitly, but their completion can be tracked using:

join()

Future.get() (when using ExecutorService)

Shared variables (careful with visibility & synchronization!)

🔹 wait() vs sleep()
sleep() pauses the current thread for a fixed time but holds the lock (if any).

wait() pauses the thread until notified and releases the lock — essential for inter-thread communication.

🔹 Synchronized Method vs Synchronized Block

Synchronized method: Locks the entire method (less flexible)

Synchronized block: Locks only the specific part of code that needs protection (more efficient)

🔹 ExecutorService
A cleaner way to manage thread pools and task execution. It abstracts thread creation and offers better control and scalability.

🔹 Callable vs Runnable
Runnable: No return value, can't throw checked exceptions
Callable<V>: Returns a result and can throw checked exceptions — ideal for tasks with results


💡 Every line of code dealing with concurrency needs intention. It's not just about performance — it’s about correctness and safety.

SQL Interview Questions at Nucleus Software – SQL Developer Role 💻

Recently, I interviewed for a SQL Developer position at Nucleus Software, and I wanted to share some of the technical questions I faced. Hope this helps anyone preparing for a similar role!

🧠 Key SQL Questions Asked:

🔹 Write a SQL query to return the day of the week (like Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for a given date.

SELECT event_name, date, DAYNAME(date) AS day_of_week
FROM events;

🔹 Explain the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses.
🔹 What are window functions? Can you write a query using RANK() and DENSE_RANK()?

🔹 How do indexes work? When should we avoid using them?

index is used to find the page number so that we can immediately go to that page number  so it is reduces time.
create index index_name on dbo.inventory 


🔹 How to detect and handle duplicate records in a table?
🔹 Write a query to transpose rows to columns (Pivot).
🔹 What is the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN?
🔹 Real-life scenario: Given a table with millions of records, how would you optimize a slow-running query?
🔹 How do you handle NULL values in SQL joins and aggregations?
🔹 Explain the purpose and use of stored procedures, triggers, and views in a project.
📌 Pro Tip: Along with strong SQL query skills, focus on query optimization, schema understanding, and real-time project experience.
