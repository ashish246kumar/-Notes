Q)Not say thats end from my side when you introduce yourSelf.Insted say thank you so much
Q)what is the diffrence between @Service annotation @Component annotation and @Repository annotation
service we are using as a service layer and repository layer and these all are sterotype annotation
@Component i put on a class that take a part in dependency registration . if i put on a class it will be register into class path and application context and all those ioc container
will be peak those bean from there because i have put those @Anotation .

for(String s:str){
  res.add(s);
}
final Map<String,Integer> resMap=res.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity)
