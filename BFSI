Finance lease, also known as Full Payout Lease, is a type of lease wherein the lessor transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards related to the asset to the lessee. Generally, the ownership is transferred to the lessee at the end of the economic life of 
the asset.
*****************************
In a non-net lease, the person who owns the property (the lessor) takes care of things like maintenance,
insurance, and other small expenses related to the property.
************************************************************************************************
But in a net lease, the lessor doesn't worry about these expenses. 
Instead, they only provide the property and handle financial matters, like collecting rent.
