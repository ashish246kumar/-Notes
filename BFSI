Finance lease, also known as Full Payout Lease, is a type of lease wherein the lessor transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards related to the asset to the lessee. Generally, the ownership is transferred to the lessee at the end of the economic life of 
the asset.
*****************************
In a non-net lease, the person who owns the property (the lessor) takes care of things like maintenance,
insurance, and other small expenses related to the property.
************************************************************************************************
But in a net lease, the lessor doesn't worry about these expenses. 
Instead, they only provide the property and handle financial matters, like collecting rent.

Here's a comparison of loans and mortgages in tabular form:

| Aspect            | Loan                               | Mortgage                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Purpose           | Can be used for various purposes such as buying a car, financing education, or consolidating debt | Specifically used for purchasing real estate property |
| Collateral        | May or may not require collateral depending on the type of loan (e.g., secured loans require collateral, unsecured loans do not) | Requires the property being purchased as collateral |
| Interest Rates    | Interest rates can vary depending on the type of loan, credit score, and lender | Typically have lower interest rates compared to other types of loans due to the collateral |
| Repayment Terms   | Repayment terms vary widely depending on the type of loan, ranging from a few months to several years | Repayment terms are usually longer, often spanning 15 to 30 years |
| Loan Amount       | Loan amount can vary greatly depending on the lender, borrower's creditworthiness, and purpose of the loan | Loan amount is typically determined by the purchase price of the property and the borrower's ability to repay |
| Down Payment      | Down payment may or may not be required depending on the type of loan and lender | A down payment is usually required, typically ranging from 3% to 20% of the purchase price |
| Closing Costs     | May have associated closing costs, which can include origination fees, application fees, and processing fees | Typically involve higher closing costs compared to other types of loans, including appraisal fees, title insurance, and attorney fees |
| Foreclosure Risk  | Generally lower risk of foreclosure since the loan is not tied to a specific asset | Higher risk of foreclosure if the borrower fails to make mortgage payments, potentially leading to the loss of the property |
| Flexibility       | Depending on the type of loan, there may be more flexibility in terms of repayment options and usage of funds | Typically less flexibility in terms of repayment options, as the loan is specifically tied to the property being purchased |
| Tax Benefits      | Depending on the purpose of the loan, some loans may offer tax benefits such as deductible interest payments | Mortgage interest payments are often tax-deductible, providing potential tax benefits for homeowners |
| Examples          | Personal loans, auto loans, student loans | Home purchase loans, refinance loans, home equity loans |
