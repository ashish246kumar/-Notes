System design of scalable url shortner service
Tiny url are exceedingly handy to share through sms/tweets (where there is limit to number of characters that can be messaged/tweeted) 
********************************************
basis for functional requirements.
How long a tiny url would be ? Will it ever expire ?
Can a customer create a tiny url of his/her choice or will it always be service generated ? 
If user is allowed to create customer shortened links, what would be the maximum size of custom url ?
How many url shortening request expected per month ?
Do we expect service to provide metrics like most visited links ?
Click to the short URL should redirect the user to the original long URL
Shortened link should be as small as possible
Users can create custom url with maximum character limit of 16
Service should collect metrics like most clicked links
Once a shortened link is generated it should stay in system for lifetime


Non-Functional Requirements:

Service should be up and running all the time
URL redirection should be fast and should not degrade at any point of time (Even during peak loads)
Service should expose REST APIâ€™s so that it can be integrated with third party applications

api_key: A unique API key provided to each user, to protect from the spammers, access, and resource control for the user, etc.
