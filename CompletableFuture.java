CompletableFuture API. It provides a way to 
perform asynchronous programming in Java, enabling you to execute tasks concurrently and handle their results when they become available.
In the context of CompletableFuture, callback functions are represented by methods like thenApply, thenAccept, thenRun.
*************************************************************************************************
CompletableFuture provides a more flexible and powerful API for working with asynchronous computations than Future. It offers non-blocking methods, composition methods, better
exception handling, and explicit completion methods, which makes it easier to write robust and scalable concurrent code.
