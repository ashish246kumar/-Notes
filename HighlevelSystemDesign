Capacity Estimation Summary
User Base
Total active users: 500 million
Daily active users: 100 million
Average streams per user per day: 10
Song catalog size: 100 million songs

Network Bandwidth Estimation
Daily song streams:
100 million users × 10 songs = 1 billion streams/day

Daily data transfer:
1 billion × 5 MB/song = 5 petabytes/day

Data transfer per second:
5 PB / 86,400 seconds = 58 GB/second

Storage Estimation
Total storage for music:
100 million songs × 5 MB/song = 500 TB

Song metadata storage:
100 million songs × 2 KB/song = 200 GB

User data storage:
500 million users × 10 KB/user = 5 TB

Caching Estimation
Top 20% of songs contribute to 80% of requests (Pareto principle).
Top 20% songs = 20 million songs.

Cache size for top songs:
20 million songs × 2 KB/song = 40 GB
