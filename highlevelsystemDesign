Parking System Design 
***********
Requirements
********************************
Big parking lots--->10k to 30k
4 entranses-4 exits
customer collected the ticket at the entranse
parking spot should be nearest to the entranse.
limit-capacity-->30k
parking spots-->Handi caped,compact, large vehicle, motorcycle
hourely  rate
cash and credit cards
montering system
**********
Bottom up approach
1)  parking lot system
2)  Entry and Exit terminal-->a) printer b) payment processor  
3) parking spot 
4) Ticket 
5) Database 
6)Monitoring system 
******************
parking spot is my actor 
enum parking spot{
handicapped,
large,
compact,
motorcycle
  } if we chose enum then it is voilating open closed designed principle as  one mroe spot is added it require changes  in more than one place also
  so better approach will be 
abstract class:->  Parkingspot -->id,reservespot --> and it has getter and setter method. 
class-->HandicappedParking Spot, CompactParkingSpot, LargeParkingSpot,MotorCycleParkingSpot  each of the class is extending abstract class parkingSpot

*************************************
ParkingTicket:- id, parking spot id , parking spot type,issue time
**************************
Terminal:->  getId()
Entry Terminal:-  getTicket(parking spot type)--> below both the class are extending abstract class Terminal or implementing Terminal
Exit terminal:-acceptTicket(Ticket)
*************************
Strategy design pattern is used here
interface:
parking Assignment Strategy->getParkingSpot(Terminal terminal), releaseParkingSpot(ParkingSpot parkingSpot) 
class:ParkingSpotNearEntranceStrategy--> implementing parking Assignment Strategy
here the question is how we implement the parking Assignment Strategy  in my requirement there are four entranse and 4 exit so we will minheap here 
*******************
Strategy design pattern is used here
Payment Processor Interface:  prices(amount)
class:CreditCard Payment processor :-> implementing Payment Processor Interface
class: CashPayment processor

********************************************************************************************gpt response:--------------------------*********************************************************

Requirements
Scale: Large parking lots with capacity between 10k to 30k spots.
Access Points: 4 entrances and 4 exits.
Customer Interaction:
Collect a ticket at the entrance.
Payment can be made via cash or credit cards.
Spot Assignment:
Assign spots nearest to the entrance.
Support various vehicle types:
Handicapped
Compact
Large Vehicle
Motorcycle
Monitoring System:
Track spot availability and monitor parking lot activity.
Billing:
Hourly rates based on vehicle type.
Future-proof:
Ensure scalability and adherence to SOLID principles.
********
ottom-Up Design
1. Parking Spot
Design Approach: Use an abstract class instead of an enum to avoid violating the Open/Closed Principle.

Abstract Class: ParkingSpot

Attributes: id, isReserved, type, getter and setter methods.
Methods: reserveSpot(), releaseSpot().
Concrete Classes:

HandicappedParkingSpot
CompactParkingSpot
LargeParkingSpot
MotorcycleParkingSpot
abstract class ParkingSpot {
    private String id;
    private boolean isReserved;
    private String type; // e.g., Handicapped, Compact

    public abstract void reserveSpot();
    public abstract void releaseSpot();

    // Getters and Setters
}

class HandicappedParkingSpot extends ParkingSpot {
    @Override
    public void reserveSpot() { /* Implementation */ }
    @Override
    public void releaseSpot() { /* Implementation */ }
}
// Similar for CompactParkingSpot, LargeParkingSpot, MotorcycleParkingSpot
*******
 Parking Ticket
Attributes:
id
parkingSpotId
parkingSpotType
issueTime
exitTime (for billing).

class ParkingTicket {
    private String id;
    private String parkingSpotId;
    private String parkingSpotType;
    private LocalDateTime issueTime;
    private LocalDateTime exitTime;

    // Getters and Setters
}
*****************
3. Terminal
Abstract Class: Terminal

getId(): Returns the terminal ID.
Entry Terminal:

getTicket(ParkingSpotType type): Generates a ticket for the requested spot type.
Exit Terminal:

acceptTicket(Ticket ticket): Processes payment and marks the spot as available.

abstract class Terminal {
    private String id;
    public abstract String getId();
}

class EntryTerminal extends Terminal {
    public ParkingTicket getTicket(String parkingSpotType) {
        // Logic for ticket generation
    }
}

class ExitTerminal extends Terminal {
    public void acceptTicket(ParkingTicket ticket) {
        // Logic for processing payment
    }
}
******
4. Parking Assignment Strategy
Interface: ParkingAssignmentStrategy

getParkingSpot(Terminal terminal): Assigns a spot nearest to the terminal.
releaseParkingSpot(ParkingSpot parkingSpot): Releases a reserved spot.
Implementation: ParkingSpotNearEntranceStrategy

Use a min-heap to store available spots by distance to the entrance.
interface ParkingAssignmentStrategy {
    ParkingSpot getParkingSpot(Terminal terminal);
    void releaseParkingSpot(ParkingSpot parkingSpot);
}

class ParkingSpotNearEntranceStrategy implements ParkingAssignmentStrategy {
    private PriorityQueue<ParkingSpot> spotQueue;

    @Override
    public ParkingSpot getParkingSpot(Terminal terminal) {
        // Assign the nearest available spot
    }

    @Override
    public void releaseParkingSpot(ParkingSpot parkingSpot) {
        // Mark the spot as available
    }
}
***************
5) Payment Processor
Interface: PaymentProcessor

processPayment(double amount).
Concrete Classes:

CreditCardPaymentProcessor
CashPaymentProcessor

interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

class CreditCardPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Credit card payment logic
    }
}

class CashPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Cash payment logic
    }
}
****
6. Monitoring System
Tracks parking lot status:
Total spots, reserved spots, available spots.
Generates reports.
java
Copy code
class MonitoringSystem {
    private Map<String, ParkingSpot> parkingSpotStatus;

    public void updateStatus(ParkingSpot spot, boolean isReserved) {
        // Update parking lot status
    }

    public void generateReport() {
        // Generate status report
    }
}
*****
7. Database
Store:
ParkingSpot details.
Tickets issued.
Payment transactions.
Use SQL or NoSQL based on scalability needs
*******
Strategy Pattern:

For parking spot assignment (ParkingAssignmentStrategy).
For payment processing (PaymentProcessor).
SOLID Principles:

Open/Closed Principle: Abstract class for ParkingSpot.
Single Responsibility Principle: Separate classes for ticket generation, payment, and monitoring.
Min-Heap:

Efficiently assign nearest parking spots.
