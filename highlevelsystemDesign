Parking System Design 
***********
Requirements
********************************
Big parking lots--->10k to 30k
4 entranses-4 exits
customer collected the ticket at the entranse
parking spot should be nearest to the entranse.
limit-capacity-->30k
parking spots-->Handi caped,compact, large vehicle, motorcycle
hourely  rate
cash and credit cards
montering system
**********
Bottom up approach
1)  parking lot system
2)  Entry and Exit terminal-->a) printer b) payment processor  
3) parking spot 
4) Ticket 
5) Database 
6)Monitoring system 
******************
parking spot is my actor 
enum parking spot{
handicapped,
large,
compact,
motorcycle
  } if we chose enum then it is voilating open closed designed principle as  one mroe spot is added it require changes  in more than one place also
  so better approach will be 
abstract class:->  Parkingspot -->id,reservespot --> and it has getter and setter method. 
class-->HandicappedParking Spot, CompactParkingSpot, LargeParkingSpot,MotorCycleParkingSpot  each of the class is extending abstract class parkingSpot

*************************************
ParkingTicket:- id, parking spot id , parking spot type,issue time
**************************
Terminal:->  getId()
Entry Terminal:-  getTicket(parking spot type)--> below both the class are extending abstract class Terminal or implementing Terminal
Exit terminal:-acceptTicket(Ticket)
*************************
Strategy design pattern is used here
interface:
parking Assignment Strategy->getParkingSpot(Terminal terminal), releaseParkingSpot(ParkingSpot parkingSpot) 
class:ParkingSpotNearEntranceStrategy--> implementing parking Assignment Strategy
here the question is how we implement the parking Assignment Strategy  in my requirement there are four entranse and 4 exit so we will minheap here 
*******************
Strategy design pattern is used here
Payment Processor Interface:  prices(amount)
class:CreditCard Payment processor :-> implementing Payment Processor Interface
class: CashPayment processor

********
ottom-Up Design
1. Parking Spot
Design Approach: Use an abstract class instead of an enum to avoid violating the Open/Closed Principle.

Abstract Class: ParkingSpot

Attributes: id, isReserved, type, getter and setter methods.
Methods: reserveSpot(), releaseSpot().
Concrete Classes:

HandicappedParkingSpot
CompactParkingSpot
LargeParkingSpot
MotorcycleParkingSpot
abstract class ParkingSpot {
    private String id;
    private boolean isReserved;
    private String type; // e.g., Handicapped, Compact

    public abstract void reserveSpot();
    public abstract void releaseSpot();

    // Getters and Setters
}

class HandicappedParkingSpot extends ParkingSpot {
    @Override
    public void reserveSpot() { /* Implementation */ }
    @Override
    public void releaseSpot() { /* Implementation */ }
}
// Similar for CompactParkingSpot, LargeParkingSpot, MotorcycleParkingSpot
*******
 Parking Ticket
Attributes:
id
parkingSpotId
parkingSpotType
issueTime
exitTime (for billing).

class ParkingTicket {
    private String id;
    private String parkingSpotId;
    private String parkingSpotType;
    private LocalDateTime issueTime;
    private LocalDateTime exitTime;

    // Getters and Setters
}
*****************
3. Terminal
Abstract Class: Terminal

getId(): Returns the terminal ID.
Entry Terminal:

getTicket(ParkingSpotType type): Generates a ticket for the requested spot type.
Exit Terminal:

acceptTicket(Ticket ticket): Processes payment and marks the spot as available.

abstract class Terminal {
    private String id;
    public abstract String getId();
}

class EntryTerminal extends Terminal {
    public ParkingTicket getTicket(String parkingSpotType) {
        // Logic for ticket generation
    }
}

class ExitTerminal extends Terminal {
    public void acceptTicket(ParkingTicket ticket) {
        // Logic for processing payment
    }
}
******
4. Parking Assignment Strategy
Interface: ParkingAssignmentStrategy

getParkingSpot(Terminal terminal): Assigns a spot nearest to the terminal.
releaseParkingSpot(ParkingSpot parkingSpot): Releases a reserved spot.
Implementation: ParkingSpotNearEntranceStrategy

Use a min-heap to store available spots by distance to the entrance.
interface ParkingAssignmentStrategy {
    ParkingSpot getParkingSpot(Terminal terminal);
    void releaseParkingSpot(ParkingSpot parkingSpot);
}

class ParkingSpotNearEntranceStrategy implements ParkingAssignmentStrategy {
    private PriorityQueue<ParkingSpot> spotQueue;

    @Override
    public ParkingSpot getParkingSpot(Terminal terminal) {
        // Assign the nearest available spot
    }

    @Override
    public void releaseParkingSpot(ParkingSpot parkingSpot) {
        // Mark the spot as available
    }
}
***************
5) Payment Processor
Interface: PaymentProcessor

processPayment(double amount).
Concrete Classes:

CreditCardPaymentProcessor
CashPaymentProcessor

interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

class CreditCardPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Credit card payment logic
    }
}

class CashPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Cash payment logic
    }
}
****
6. Monitoring System
Tracks parking lot status:
Total spots, reserved spots, available spots.
Generates reports.
java
Copy code
class MonitoringSystem {
    private Map<String, ParkingSpot> parkingSpotStatus;

    public void updateStatus(ParkingSpot spot, boolean isReserved) {
        // Update parking lot status
    }

    public void generateReport() {
        // Generate status report
    }
}
*****
7. Database
Store:
ParkingSpot details.
Tickets issued.
Payment transactions.
Use SQL or NoSQL based on scalability needs
*******
Strategy Pattern:

For parking spot assignment (ParkingAssignmentStrategy).
For payment processing (PaymentProcessor).
SOLID Principles:

Open/Closed Principle: Abstract class for ParkingSpot.
Single Responsibility Principle: Separate classes for ticket generation, payment, and monitoring.
Min-Heap:

Efficiently assign nearest parking spots.

DropBox
Features
upload/download the files
Sync folder
History of updates
****************
scale:-10+million users
100 milion request per day
High write and read
**********************************************************************************************
Account-->normal user and premium user
root folder->replicated to all the devices
files/folder sharing ->user should  be able to share it
read/write acess
a user can only share files or folder which he owns| the owner has full access while other user has read
1gb
the user should be able to support certain file upto certain limit 
once the user has reached the file storage limit the system should not allow any other write
the system should allow multiple version of file and user should be able to recover to previous version
how the versioning should be performed whether it should be an update from another update or it is daily snapshot of all the update 
how it affect files and folder which are shared among various user
if a user with read/write access decided to revert some changes of file how those changes will be replicated to the devices of all the other user
how will it ffect the capacity of the user
how the versioning should performed
wheher it is an update to update or daily snapshot
how will it affect the files and folder which are shared among various user
if a user with  read write access decide to decide to revert a some changes of file . how those changes will be replicated to devices of all the other user. 
how will it affect the storage capacity of the user whether the total space consumed by each version or  snapshot is counted toward the total space consumed by the user
or not what should be done once a user has reached its limit in that case should we start dropping older version or should we just stop creating new version etc.
so you clarify this type requirement and constraint. Another extended requirement is the system should be able to keep the track of all the anakytics . related to storage 
and network consumption. Also one of the exchange requirement is which actually come into picture when you start allowing sharing of files and folder among user 
that what will happen if two users try to update a same file and if the conflict arises because of that how will that resolve conflict another important requirement 
data security . the risk of data read during transmission can be mitigated throgh encryption technology .encryption in transient protect data as it being transmitted
to and from device to cloud or vice versa encryption at rest protect data that is stored in the cloud service. another requirement is to provide such a facility so that 
user can actually able to go and search file and folder. so these are the different functional requirement.
*******************************
Non functional requirement
The system need to be highly availavble and folt tolrent. the second non functional requirement is system should be highly scalable and it should inc with increasing load 
or increasing users and data the third requirement is the file synchronization should use minimal network bandwidth. the fourth non functional requirement is 
file transfer should happen with minimum latency. these two non functional requirement about the file simulation require
